Plan and possibilities for InfTest
========================================

1) illustrate everything with wizards/new interface

1a) add builtins

2) add conversion of text files to n3 to whatever ( in two steps ) with selection of parts

2a) following formats: N3, RDF/XML, OWL should be converted to internal format
 (interface.js) and back.

2b) implements namespaces control

3) establish association matrixes (experimental)

4) make n3stylesheets

5) implement remote inferencing

5a) publish -subscribe paradigm

5b) soa(services oriented architecture) - esb(enterprise service bus) using XML, N3, RDF/XML, OWL,
HTTP, HTTPS, HTML and remote inferencing.

5c) N3 over SOAP

5d) description and implementation of web services in N3
With a (set of) N3 file(s) a query can be exposed as a web service;
the query is encapsulated in soap; WDSL describes the service.

6) implement rdf parsing and rdf => n3

7) implement javascript in n3 files; in rules; start, proc, finish procedures.

8) make n3 objects and procedures

9) n3 database interface

10) automatic data entry screens 

11) make description logic reasoner

12) hide namespaces

13) convert XML to N3 eg
<tag1>
   <tag2>
      blabla
   </tag2>
</tag1>
becomes
"tag1" x:tag; x:content ""; x:child "tag2".
"tag2" x:tag; x:content "blabla"; x:parent "tag1".
 then rules can be applied to the XML/N3 source.
 Application: convert SOAP to N3 and apply rules for interpreting and executing
 SOAP messages.

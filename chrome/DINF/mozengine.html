   <i><b>Mozilla inference engine</b></i>

    <pre>
    Quick start: double click on testinf.xul.
    
    The directory rdftest contains as most important new features compared with rdfinf:
    1) the Notation 3 parser N3EParser.js
    2) a forward reasoner Forward.js. The forward reasoner was developed in order to be
       able to implement log:Conclusion. 
    
    The main screen of the application is testinf.xul.
    The screen has following functionalities:
    Under the label "Messages" appear messages from the program: 
    parser errors and messages from the inference engine.
    Under the label "Testcases" a testcase can be selected.
    The name of the testcase is selected by the first choicebox.
    The next three buttons (execute testcase, forward only and backward only) 
    determine the choice of inference engine:
    execute testcase:  executes first with the backward reasoner and
    then with the forward reasoner; execution times can be compared
    when the verbose flag is off.
    forward only: the forward reasoner is used
    backward only: the backward reasoner is used.
    The next choicebox permits to toggle the verbose flag:
    if the flag is set, information about the inferencing process is 
    written in the output screen; otherwise only the results are shown.
    
    The next button ("load file to test")permits to make your own testcase:
    each time the button is pushed a file can be selected.
    The filename is put into a buffer.
    When a certain number of files has been entered of which the last file is the queryfile,
    then a query can be executed by one of the executing buttons above
    (execute testcase, forward only, backward only).
    When the buffer is flushed with the button "flush buffer" the selected testcase 
    in the first choicebox will be active again.
    Finally, the last button "clear textarea" permits to clear the textarea.

    Modules - screens:
    
    testinf.xul: the main (and only) program screen.
    N3EParser.js: the Notation 3 Parser
    Jsengine.js: the finite state machine for the backward reasoner
    RDFEngine.js: the backward reasoning engine
    Forward.js: finite state machine and forward reasoner
    RDFUnify.js: substitution and unification functions
    interface.js: the functions that define the interface 'interface.txt'.
    builtins.js: module for builtins (not yet used)
    Utils.js: utility functions for parsing.

<b>Menu Apps</b><br>
This is the application menu. You can open applications: <i>"Open App"</i>, save applications: <i>"Save App"</i> or save applications
 with a new name: <i>"Save App As"</i>.<br>
 An application is a file describing a set of a Notation 3 (N3) data file, a file containing queries in  Notation 3 format
  and  parameters. The application file has the suffix .app and is also in format N3.<br>
 <b>Notation 3</b> has a central role in this program. It was developed by <i>Tim Berners-Lee</i><br>
 An explanation of his hand can be found on: <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer">Notation 3</A><br> <br>
 The <i>'Exit'</i> menuitem first asks the user if does not want to save the application. If he
 says 'Yes' then the application save process is executed and then the system exits. If he says 'No'
  the system exits immediately.  <p>
<b>Menu Wizards</b><br>
The <i>'Demo'</i> menuitem uses alert boxes, might seem somewhat strange but you can quickly learn the most important things.<br>
The <i>'QuickStartWizard'</i> menuitem gives more or less the same information, but uses the XUL wizard system.<p>
The <i>'Application Flow Chart'</i> menuitem show a flow chart that demonstrates how to create an application.<p>
<b>Menu Web Services</b><br>
The <i>'Start Server'</i> menuitem starts the web service server.<p>
The <i>'Stop Server'</i> menuitem stops the web service server.<p>
The <i>'Save Web Service'</i> menuitem saves the source code in the zone "Source Code" as a web service.<br>
See 'Menu Help', item 'Web Services' for an explanation of the mechanism. <p>
The <i>'Query Web Service'</i> menuitem permits to query a web service who was created with the DINF system.<br>
(No other web services!!!).<p>
The <i>'Set Port'</i> menuitem permits to change the TCP/IP port on which the web service server is listening.<br>
The default is: 10000.<p>
The <i>'View WSDL'</i> shows the WSDL definition of the webservice.There is one unique web service for <br>
querying all N3 files.<p>
<b>Menu Source Code</b><br>
Though this product is intended to work with files in Notation 3 format, nevertheless with the menuitem <i>'Open'</i> 
 you can read any file. There is a filter wich selects the N3 files, but you can change this with eg *.txt in the file 
 selection zone.  You can then eventually edit this file or merge with other files and then save it with <i>'Save'</i> 
 or, if you want to change the name, with: <i>'Save As'</i>.<br>
With <i>'Save Queries'</i> you can save the queries. If a name is known for the queryfile then it will be used. Otherwise 
a name will be asked for. <br>
With <i>'Save Output'</i> the output zone will be saved to a file. The system will always ask for a filename.<br>
With <i>'Save Messages'</i> the message zone will be saved to a file. The system will always ask for a filename.
<p>
<b>Menu Print</b><br>
With this menu different zones of the screen can be printed. <br>
With <i>'Print source'</i> the source zone will be printed.<br>
With <i>'Print output'</i> the output zone will be printed.<br>
With <i>'Print messages'</i> the message zone will be printed.<p>

<b>Menu Clear</b><br>
With this menu different zones of the screen can be cleared. <br>
With <i>'Clear output'</i> the output zone can be cleared.<br>
With <i>'Clear source'</i> the source zone can be cleared.<br>
With <i>'Clear messages'</i> the message zone can be cleared.<br>
With <i>'Clear query'</i> the query zone can be cleared.<p>
<b>Menu Reasoners</b><br>
The DINF package supports two reasoners: a forward reasoner and a backward reasoner. 
By default the forward reasoner will be used. Here however you can select also the backward reasoner.<br>
With <i>'Forward reasoner'</i> you select the forward reasoner.<br>
With <i>'Backward reasoner'</i> you select the backward reasoner.<p>
<b>Menu Help</b><br>
With <i>'Content'</i> this text is displayed.<br>
With <i>'About'</i> the acronym DINF is explained (<b>D</b>istributed <b>Inf</b>erencing) 
and the version of the system is given (1.0).

<b>Other contents of the screen</b><br>
Now I will say something about the textareas, lists and buttons that are on the screen.
<br><br>
<b><u>Left part of the screen</u></b><br>
Under the heading <i>'Most recent apps'</i> a list is maintained of the most recently opened apps.<br>
The number of apps in that list is limited to 10.<br>
Under the list is a button <i>'Load app'</i> for laoding an application and a button <br>
<i>'Delete app'</i> for deleting an application <b>from the list.</b>The application itself <br>
will not be deleted!<p>
Under these buttons there is the textarea labeled <i>'Output'</i>. Here the output of queries is shown.<br>
Under the textarea is a button <i>'Clear output'</i> for clearing the textarea. <p><br>
<b><u>Central part of the screen</u></b><br>
The textarea labeled <i>'Source code'</i> is meant to contain N3(Notation 3 ) source code.<br>
The user is naturally free to enter whatever he likes. The contents can be saved by using the menu 'Source Code'.<br>
Under the 'Source code' textarea we have the <i>'Messages'</i> textarea, where normally messages of the system will appear.<br>
All textareas are writable and can be saved to disk. This can be handy for adding commentaries and keeping them.<br>
<br><p>
<b><u>Right part of the screen</u></b><br>
The textarea labeled <i>'QUERIES'</i> is used for querying the N3 source code that is in the 'Source code' area.<br>
Queries are N3 statements that can contain variables; for more explanation see: <br>
<A HREF="http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2004/02swap/RDFEngine/inferencing.htm">Inferencing with RDF and Notation 3 for beginners</A><br>
The button <i>'Execute'</i> under the textarea will execute the query and the results of the query will be exposed in 
the 'Output' textarea.<br>
The button <i>'Add query'</i> will add the query to the list of queries labeled <i>'Query list'</i>.<br>
This is usefull is there are queries you want to use regularly, also for querying web services.<br>
The list of queries can be saved to disk.<br><p>
The we have the query list. Queries can be saved in this list by giving them a name. A query can be sleceted by its name and<br>
moved to the 'QUERIES' textarea for execution. A window with a list of available queries can be obtained.<br>
There are quit some manipulations possible on the queries:<br>
- the button <i>'Select query'</i> moves the query that is selected in the list to the 'QUERIES' textarea.<br>
- the button <i>'Delete query'</i> removes the selected query from the list.<br>
- the button <i>'Rename query'</i> gives a different name to teh selected query.<br>
- the button <i>'Show queries'</i> will show the list of names and their associated query in a separate window.<br>
- the button <i>'Save'</i> will save the list of queries to disk.<br>
- the button <i>'Restore'</i> will fill the list by reading a query file from the disk.<br>

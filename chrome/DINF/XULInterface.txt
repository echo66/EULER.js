Interface for a dynamic XUL Window based on N3 inferencing
============================================================

Author: Guido J.M. Naudts Bouwel

All the following functions are defined for an object:
object = new inferenceModule();
e.g. object.addSetByFilenameForInf("tst", "d", "axioms.n3");

addSetByFilename(name, type, filename):
	name: name by which this set of triples is known in the program
        type: the type of file:
              "d" = data
              "r" = rules
              "a" = axioms (data + rules)
              "q" = query
        filename: the name of the N3 file
    Return: null
    Example: addSetByFilename("authen", "a", "authen.axiom.n3");

addSetByStringArray(name, type, array):
	name: name by which this set of triples is known in the program
        type: the type of file:
              "d" = data
              "r" = rules
              "a" = axioms (data + rules)
              "q" = query
        array: an array of strings in N3 format
     Return: null 
     Example: addSetByArray("query", "q",
               ["@prefix : <authen#>", "?who :authenticated ?what."]);

Note: executing addSetByFilename and addSetByStringArray
      a second time with the same name will overwrite the
      previous entered file.

addSetByString(name, type, str):
	    name: name by which this set of triples is known in the program
          type: the type of file:
              "d" = data
              "r" = rules
              "a" = axioms (data + rules)
              "q" = query
         str: an N3 file as string
         Return: null
         Example: addSetByString("query", "q",
               "@prefix : <authen#>\n?who :authenticated ?what.");

makeInfDB(dbName, fileList):
         dbName: name of the db
         fileList: list of names of N3 sets
         Do not enter query sets here!!!!

     Return: null
     Example: makeInfDB("myDB", ["authen", "data"]);
     Note: a default db is constituted by all entered files by the 
           commands addFileByName and addFileByArray
           with the exception of query files

queryInfDB(dbName, queryName):
         dbName: name of a db
         queryName: name of a queryfile
     Return: an array of arrays.
            The second order arrays are arrays of strings
            in N3 format; each string array represents a solution
            i.e. the query with all variables substituted
            by resources.  
     Example: queryInfDB("myDB", "query");

getDB(dbName):
         dbName: name of a db
 Return: a tripleset.
 Example: getDB("authen");

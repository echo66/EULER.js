To get started
==================

DINF stands for Distributed Inferencing.
You must have xulrunner installed for running the packet.
There is a bat file for starting the packet:
DINF.bat
In this bat file you should adapt the commando for starting XULRunner according to the location of xulrunner in your system.
For Linux or Unix make the necessary adaptions in your Linux or Unix system.
Once the main screen is started you can find explanations under the menu item 'help' and wizards and demos under the menu item 'wizards'.
